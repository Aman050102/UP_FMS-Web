## 📝 Project Overview
Currently, the sports facility services, equipment borrowing, and booking systems at the University of Phayao still rely heavily on manual recording and Microsoft Excel files. This process often leads to delays, data inaccuracies, and difficulties in analyzing usage patterns for facility development and resource management.

This project aims to develop the **Sports Facility Usage Tracking and Analytics System** to transform these manual processes into a digital ecosystem. By focusing on data accuracy, online accessibility, and real-time visualization, the system will empower administrators to manage sports resources more effectively.

### Objectives
* **Efficiency:** To streamline sports facility management through an integrated digital platform.
* **Accuracy:** To enhance data integrity and minimize human errors in record-keeping.
* **Workload Reduction:** To automate report generation and data compilation for staff.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** To provide statistical dashboards and graphs for better executive decision-making.
